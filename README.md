# **Buck Converter Design: En-Core 1.0**

## **Introduction**
This project involves designing a non-isolated buck converter that steps down a 24V input to a 5V output with an efficiency of at least 90%. The buck converter is essential in many power conversion applications, such as power supplies and electric vehicles. 

### **Key Specifications:**
- **Input Voltage (Vin):** 24V (±2% tolerance)
- **Output Voltage (Vout):** 5V (±0.01V)
- **Input Current:** 1A max
- **Efficiency:** ≥ 90%
- **Form Factor:** Max PCB size of 10 cm x 5 cm

## **Theoretical Background**
A buck converter reduces the input voltage to a lower output voltage by switching a MOSFET on and off. The energy is stored in an inductor and smoothed out by a capacitor. The main components are:
- **Schottky Diode (1N5817):** Minimizes losses.
- **PWM Source (NE555 Timer):** Generates the switching signal.
- **Inductor and Capacitor:** For energy storage and output voltage smoothing.

### **Efficiency Calculation:**
Efficiency depends on losses in the MOSFET (switching and conduction losses), inductor, and other components.

## **Simulation and Testing**

The circuit was simulated to verify the design, focusing on:
- Input voltage (24V DC)
- PWM signal generated by the NE555 (duty cycle 20.8%)
- Output voltage (5V with 0.02V ripple)

**Simulation Graphs:**
- **Green:** 24V input voltage
- **Blue:** PWM signal from the NE555 timer
- **Red:** 5V output DC voltage

## **Conclusion**
The buck converter successfully steps down 24V to 5V with over 90% efficiency, meeting all design and dimensional constraints.
